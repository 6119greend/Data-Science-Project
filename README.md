# Data-Science-Project
The objective of this project is to determine which specific demographic is predictive of the presidential vote. This analysis was chosen in response the controversial president elect, Donald Trump, as many believe conservative White Republicans controlled this election. First, county maps, scatter & bar plots will be used to determine correlation and distributions of votes based on demographics in each county. Then, based on relationships of causality, a model will be fit using least-squares estimation. This model will be evaluated using the coefficient of determination, chi-squared values and significance & normality tests.
